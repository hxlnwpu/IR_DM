Casablanca
There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. 
A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Caf¨¦ American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, 
the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans,
Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, 
with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. 
This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, 
humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you todiscover.
