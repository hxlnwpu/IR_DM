Until the 19th century and the first opium war, Shanghai was considered to be essentially a fishing village. However, in 1914, Shanghai had 200 banks dealing with 80% of its foreign investments in China. Citizens of many countries on all continents gathered in Shanghai to live and work in the ensuing decades. By 1932, Shanghai had become the world¡¯s 5th largest city and home to 70,000 foreigners. Foreign residents of the city called themselves Shanghailanders. From 1842 to 1949, while the British established settlement in a section of Shanghai, the French and the American also established their own settlements; these settlements were later called concessions. World War II marked Shanghai as a destination for refugees. Between 1937 and 1939, an estimated 20,000 Jews traveled to Shanghai to flee the Nazis, Shanghai was the only city where Jews were welcome without condition. Today, the streets of the French concession and other foreign settlements had changed to become what-to-do n¡¯ you-need avenues, while the Bund, a stretch of Western buildings is still representing the Western influence that dominated so much of the city¡¯s history.
